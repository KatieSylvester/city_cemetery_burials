This was a really messy data set, which was challenging, but it was interesting to explore.  Upon analyzing the data, I was interested to see that nearly half of the burials are women, which was surprising given the large number of Civil War related burials.  I was also curious to see the number of burials each year in comparison to a timeline of Nashville history.  I found a timeline from the Nashville Historic Commission which divided Nashville's history into eras and I grouped burials by those eras and then plotted it against the timeline in a bar chart.  It's not surprising to see that the cemetery had the most burials during three of Nashville's eaerliest eras:  Rock City (1840s-1850s), The Occupied City (1860s) and Athens of the South (1870s-1900).
